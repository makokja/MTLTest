Candidate Assignment

Instructions:

The sample application is developed using Go. Our development team would like to deliver this application to Production. As a DevOps engineer, you are responsible to complete the tasks by following these key areas: High Availability, Scalability, Security.

Task:

1. Create a Dockerfile for a given application

Expected Output: Dockerfile

2. Build the image using the Dockerfile and push to Docker Hub

Expected Output: Build and push command and Docker Hub url
https://hub.docker.com/r/makokja/test-go-app

3. Create a Helm Chart to deploy the image from the previous step. The chart should support

- Simple deployment (Deployment, Service, Ingress, etc)

- Argo Rollout resources (https://argo-rollouts.readthedocs.io/en/stable) to perform Canary Deployment and BlueGreen Deployment

The chart should also have flexibility to allow Developers to adjust Values. They can choose to use either simple deployment or Canary or Blue Green without having to rebuild the chart frequently

Expected Output: Helm Chart with values file to deploy the application

4. Setup EKS cluster with the related resources to run EKS like VPC, Subnets, etc. by following EKS Best Practices using any IaC tools (Bonus point: use Terraform/Terragrunt)

Expected Output: IaC code

5. When the sample application deploys to EKS, they need to have access to

● S3 with permission GetObject, PutObject (S3 ARN:arn:aws:s3:::my-web-assets)

● SQS with permission; send, receive, delete message (SQS ARN: arn:aws:sqs:ap-southeast-1:123456789123:lms-import-data)

● Condition: Avoid injecting the generated aws secret/access keys to the application directly.

Expected Output: IaC code 6. Use ArgoCD to deploy this application. To follow GitOps practices, we prefer to have an ArgoCD application defined declaratively in a YAML file if possible.

Expected output: Yaml files and instruction how to deploy the application or command line

7. (Bonus point) Create CICD workflow using Github Actions to build and deploy application Expected output: Github Actions workflow (yml file) or diagram

8. Design infrastructure on AWS for 3 tier architecture that supports High Availability, serve high traffic and expect zero downtime Expected output: Diagram

Create a public Github repository and push your answers in it. Commit often - we would

rather see a history of trial and error than a single monolithic push. When you're finished, send us the URL to the repository.
